# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have been working as an econometrician in the Mathematics sector for the Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO) since 2017. 
On behalf of the FSIO, I have undertaken a research project in parallel with my office job as a PhD Student in Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) and have become a member of the [ASAM Group](www.unifr.ch/inf/asam/en/) (Applied Statistics and Modelling).

# My professional achievements
- The R package [delfin](https://github.com/swiss-adminR/201909_slides/blob/master/2019_09_19_plc_presentation_delfin.pdf) developed with my team at the FSIO (not available in github);
- The model of the [sum of the Old-Age and Survivor's Insurance (OASI) pension amounts](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/dam/bsv/fr/dokumente/ahv/finanzperspektiven/validierung-modellansatz-ahv.pdf.download.pdf/2018_07_09_definitif_ld_rapport_ofas.pdf).

# My current PhD research project

<img align="right" width="350" height="300" src=sidebar_listing.jpg>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
<!--
- a research project which aims to estimate the Swiss old-age and survivor's insurance (OASI) first pension amounts as a PhD Student at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland);-->
- the clustering of the Swiss Pension Register in the R package [rrclust](https://github.com/asam-group/rrclust) using Kamila Clustering Method with the R package [kamila](https://github.com/ahfoss/kamila) of A. Foss et al. (2016) and A. Foss et al. (2018);
- testing classification methods on the Swiss Pension Register (e.g. R packages [forestoasi](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/forestoasi) and [rrml](https://github.com/asam-group/rrml).

ðŸ¤” I intend to...

- apply the [Transformation Forests](https://github.com/cran/trtf) on the Swiss Pension Register;
- develop the [Transformation Forests](https://github.com/cran/trtf) in a time dimension.

# My other research topics
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing
- a Shiny Web App on financial stocks indicators (cf. [stock-analysis repository](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/stock-analysis)).
