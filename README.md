# My current PhD research project
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- a research project which aims to estimate the Swiss old-age and survivor's insurance (OASI) first pension amounts as a PhD Student at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland);
- the clustering of the Swiss Pension Register in the R package [rrclust](https://github.com/asam-group/rrclust) using Kamila Clustering Method with the R package [kamila](https://github.com/ahfoss/kamila) of A. Foss et al. (2016) and A. Foss et al. (2018);
- testing classification methods on the Swiss Pension Register (e.g. R packages [forestoasi](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/forestoasi) and [rrml](https://github.com/asam-group/rrml).

ðŸ¤” I'm looking forward to 
- developing the Transformation Forests in a time dimension.

# My other research topics
