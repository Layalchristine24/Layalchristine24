# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working as an econometrician in the Mathematics sector for the Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO). 
On behalf of the FSIO, I have undertaken a research project in parallel with her office job as a PhD Student in Economics and Social Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Laurent DonzÃ© at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) and have become a member of the [ASAM Group](www.unifr.ch/inf/asam/en/) (Applied Statistics and Modelling).

- a research project which aims to estimate the Swiss old-age and survivor's insurance (OASI) first pension amounts as a PhD Student at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland);
- the clustering of the Swiss Pension Register in the R package [rrclust](https://github.com/asam-group/rrclust) using Kamila Clustering Method with the R package [kamila](https://github.com/ahfoss/kamila) of A. Foss et al. (2016) and A. Foss et al. (2018);
- testing classification methods on the Swiss Pension Register (e.g. R packages [forestoasi](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/forestoasi) and [rrml](https://github.com/asam-group/rrml).

ðŸ¤” I'm looking forward to 
- developing the Transformation Forests in a time dimension.
